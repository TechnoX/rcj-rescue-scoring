In this system, it is very easy to do everything related to competition management, from course map creation to score calculation and ranking.  If you are a judge of a competition that adopts this system, please login from the button below. The competition OC knows the ID and password.  If you are a player, you can check the detailed results and ranking of the competition by choosing the competition you participated from the list below.",

When the robot finally finds the victims, it has to gently and carefully transport the victims to the safe evacuation point where humans can take over the rescue. After the victim rescue, the robot should be able to find its way out of the dangerous area. ",
